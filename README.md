# 🌟 pH Calculator 🧪

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300.png?text=pH+Calculator+Project)

## 📋 Overview
The **pH Calculator** is a simple yet powerful Python-based tool designed to compute the pH of a solution given its hydrogen ion concentration. This tool is perfect for students, chemists, and enthusiasts exploring the fascinating world of acids and bases.

---

## ⚡ Features
- 🧮 **Accurate Calculations**: Compute pH using the formula `pH = -log10([H+])`.
- 🔍 **Error Handling**: Alerts for invalid or zero values for concentration.
- 💻 **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line based for quick input/output.
